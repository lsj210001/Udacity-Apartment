## Versions

- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Platform

- Android

## Lightmap Settings 

- I trid uncompressed lightmap first, and it worked well.
- Then I trid compressed lightmap, I found its quality was lower than uncompressed lightmap, which made me uncomfortable.

## Note

- I took about six hours to complete the project.
- I liked the skybox of the project, because it was vivid and pretty.
- The particularly challenging thing was the animation. In order to finish it I changed the script.
